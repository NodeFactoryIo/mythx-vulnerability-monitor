# MythX vulnerability monitor

This is a repository for a web app that scans deployed smart contract on Ethereum blockchain with [MythX](https://mythx.io/).
App includes monitoring of the contracts periodically to detect if any new vulnerability is found on the existing contract.

## How it works
1. User logs in to MythX and receives tokens that are sent to backend.
Those tokens are saved to be used later for submissions of analyses.
2. User can enter address of the deployed contract only and therefore use only the bytcode analysis.
However, to achieve better results, additional source code of the contract can be provided.
3. Submitted contract is sent to MythX for analysis and results are sent via email.
User is provided with a URL where all previous analyses can be checked.
4. On a period of 30 days a new analysis is requested for each submitted contract.

## Requirements

Following software is required to be installed to use this repo:
 * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v8.4.0
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)
 * Docker
 * docker-compose

## Usage

### Backend
On first use of this repo, run `npx run build` which will
build backend Docker image.You will have to run `npx run build` each time
you change dependencies in package.json (yarn.lock).

Run `npx run` to see all available commands and their description.

#### Notice
* make sure you update `yarn.lock` before building
* use `sequelize-cli` local to generate migrations (because of timestamp)


### Frontend
In `frontend` directory run `yarn install` and for the local development use `yarn start`.

## Production

1. Use `Dockerfile.production` to create a backend Docker image.
2. Run `npx run prod` which should build frontend React app.
